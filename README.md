## Why PackGuard?

npm is the backbone of modern web development: nearly every website, web app and JavaScript tool is built from packages downloaded through it. Attackers regularly slip malicious packages into the registry, and a single bad package can spread into thousands of projects.

Existing detectors force a trade-off:

- **Rule-based scanners** are lightweight but miss disguised (obfuscated) malware.
- **Machine-learning detectors** catch more but need powerful hardware and constant retraining.

PackGuard tests whether we can have both: accurate detection that runs on an ordinary computer.

## How it works

```mermaid

    A[npm package] --> B[Unpack & split files<br/>8 KB overlapping chunks for large files]
    B --> C[Stage 1: Compression scanner<br/>NCD vs. known malware, raw LZMA2]

    C -->|flagged| E[Stage 2: AI filter<br/>fine-tuned ModernBERT]
    E -->|false alarm| D
    E -->|confirmed| F[Malicious]
```

**Stage 1 – Compression scanner (C).** Malicious code tends to share hidden patterns with known malware, even when disguised. PackGuard measures this with **Normalized Compression Distance (NCD)**: two files that compress much better *together* than *separately* are similar.

```
NCD(x, y) = (C(xy) − min(C(x), C(y))) / max(C(x), C(y))
```

Values near 0 mean very similar; near 1 means unrelated. Each package is scored by its most suspicious file or chunk, with a threshold tuned to catch ~99% of malware.

**Stage 2 – AI false-alarm filter (Python → ONNX).** A pretrained, code-aware model (ModernBERT) reviews **only** the packages flagged by stage 1. A hierarchical design lets it read whole packages, guided by the suspicious regions found in stage 1. The trained model is exported to ONNX, quantized to 8-bit and runs on a standard CPU through the ONNX Runtime C API, inside the same C scanner.

## Requirements

| Component | Version |
|---|---|
| C compiler | C17: GCC 11+ or Clang 14+ |
| GNU Make | 4.x |
| Windows native build | zig 0.16+, CMake 3.20+, GNU Make (e.g. `winget install zig.zig Kitware.CMake ezwinports.make`) |
| liblzma (xz) | 5.4.x or a recent 5.8.x — **never 5.6.0 or 5.6.1** (CVE-2024-3094 backdoor) |
| ONNX Runtime | 1.20+ (C API, prebuilt release) |
| Python | 3.10+ |
| Python packages | `transformers`, `datasets`, `torch`, `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `optimum` |
| GPU | Only for training (e.g. free Google Colab T4). Detection runs on CPU. |

## Getting started

### 1. Install a C toolchain and liblzma

```bash
# Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)
sudo apt install build-essential pkg-config liblzma-dev
# macOS
xcode-select --install
brew install xz pkg-config
```

On Windows, either use WSL and follow the Linux commands, or build natively (step 3b).

Check the installed liblzma version is not 5.6.0 or 5.6.1:

```bash
xz --version
```

### 2. Install ONNX Runtime (C API)

Download the prebuilt package for your platform from <https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/releases> (e.g. `onnxruntime-linux-x64-<version>.tgz`) and extract it, e.g. to `/opt/onnxruntime`. On macOS, `brew install onnxruntime` also works.

### 3. Build the scanner

```bash
make ONNXRUNTIME_ROOT=/opt/onnxruntime   # produces build/packguard
make clean                               # removes build output
```

For a single self-contained binary, link liblzma statically (`liblzma.a`); it is small and has no further dependencies. The Makefile already does this.

### 3b. Or build natively on Windows

```powershell
.\scripts\build-windows.ps1          # produces build\packguard.exe
.\scripts\build-windows.ps1 -Clean   # rebuilds liblzma too
```

The script downloads the xz 5.8.3 source, checks its pinned SHA-256 (the release is signed by Lasse Collin, key `3690 C240 CE51 B467 0D30 AD1C 38EE 757D 6918 4620`), builds a static liblzma with zig and links a single `packguard.exe` that uses Win32 threads on every logical processor. It gives byte-identical reports to the Linux build. Malware must still be handled only inside WSL, so on Windows scan only benign code.

### 4. Or build with Docker

```bash
docker build -t packguard .
docker run --rm --network none -v "$PWD/refs:/refs:ro" -v "$PWD/samples:/work:ro" packguard /refs /work/<package>
```

`--network none` and read-only mounts keep samples isolated.

### Run a scan

```bash
build/packguard [-j threads] [-p candidates] [-t threshold] [-k groups] \
                [-o report.json | -d report_dir] <reference_dir> <package_path>...
```

| Option | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `-j` | Worker threads (default: all logical processors) |
| `-p` | LZJD prefilter: run NCD only on this many most similar reference chunks per chunk (default 256; `0` scores every reference, the exact brute-force mode) |
| `-t` | Add `threshold` and `flagged` (score at or below the threshold) to the report |
| `-k` | Per chunk, also list the `k` closest reference groups (first folder below `reference_dir`, the code-shape folder in v1) |
| `-o` | Write the report of a single package to a file (default: stdout) |
| `-d` | Write one report per package to `report_dir/<package folder>.json` |

The references are loaded and their C(x) cached once, then every package is scanned in turn, so many packages per run is much faster than one run per package. Byte-identical reference chunks are scored once: v1 has 190,939 chunks but only 69,249 distinct ones, and this never changes a score. Exit status is 0 on success, 1 if any package failed and 2 for a usage error.

**Prefilter.** Comparing every chunk with all 69,249 v1 chunks by NCD takes about 34 s per small package. The scanner therefore first ranks the references with [LZJD](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.03346) (Raff and Nicholas, 2017), the Lempel-Ziv Jaccard distance: the set of phrases an LZ compressor would build, compared by a bottom-1024 min-hash. It is the same idea as NCD without running the compressor, and takes milliseconds for all of v1. NCD then runs only on the 256 most similar chunks. On the v1 detailed test this is about 160× faster (0.23 s per package) and gave every malicious package exactly its brute-force score; see [`experiments/v1/`](experiments/v1/README.md).

### 5. Train the AI filter

```bash
pip install -r training/requirements.txt
python training/finetune_packguard.py
```

## Scanner output format

The scanner writes one JSON file per package, which stage 2 reads:

```json
{
  "package": "example-pkg",
  "version": "1.0.2",
  "score": 0.41,
  "threshold": 0.5,
  "flagged": true,
  "seconds": 2.31,
  "matched_packages": [
    { "package": "evil@1.0.0", "group": "1a2b3c4d5e6f", "ncd": 0.41, "chunks": 1 }
  ],
  "chunks": [
    { "file": "install.js", "start": 0, "ncd": 0.41,
      "match": { "file": "1a2b3c4d5e6f/evil@1.0.0/index.js", "package": "evil@1.0.0", "start": 0 },
      "near": [ { "group": "1a2b3c4d5e6f", "ncd": 0.41 } ],
      "text": "..." }
  ]
}
```

Lower `ncd` = more similar to known malware. `match` is the closest reference chunk and the reference package it belongs to (the second folder below `reference_dir`, `<package>@<version>` in v1). `matched_packages` lists every reference package that was the closest match of at least one chunk, with its code-shape group, its lowest NCD and how many chunks matched it, closest first. `threshold` and `flagged` appear only with `-t`, and `near` only with `-k`. `score` is `null` when a package has no JavaScript. `text` is the chunk as UTF-8, with bytes that are not valid UTF-8 written as U+FFFD.

## Default configuration (v1)

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Comparison unit | Per file; files > 16 KB split into 8 KB chunks with 4 KB overlap |
| Compressor | Raw LZMA2 (liblzma), preset 6 (extreme off), 1 MB dictionary, `lc = 3` |
| C(xy) | Estimated as C(x) + C(y\|x), with the reference x as an LZMA preset dictionary |
| Prefilter | LZJD (bottom-1024 min-hash of the LZ phrase set); NCD on the 256 most similar reference chunks |
| Package score | Most suspicious file/chunk (minimum NCD) |
| Stage 1 threshold | Tuned for ~99% malware recall on validation data |
| Stage 2 model | ModernBERT-base, fine-tuned, 8-bit quantized ONNX |

## Datasets

The v1 malware set is in `data/v1/malware_js_0.zip` to `malware_js_f.zip` (encrypted, password `infected`): 5,904 npm packages from the DataDog dataset, stripped to plain `.js` files with no `package.json`. See [`dataset_index.md`](dataset_index.md) for how it was built. Sources used:

- [DataDog malicious software packages dataset](https://github.com/DataDog/malicious-software-packages-dataset)
- Backstabber's Knife Collection (Ohm et al., 2020)
- MalwareBench (access on request)
- [OpenSSF malicious-packages](https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages) (used to confirm live-scan detections)

Benign packages are downloaded from the public npm registry. Near-duplicates are removed and data is **split by publication date** to simulate detecting unseen attacks.

## Evaluation

- **Metrics:** precision, recall, F1, false alarm rate, processing time, memory use
- **Baseline:** GuardDog, evaluated on the same test data
- **Experiments:** compressor (xz vs. zstd vs. PPMd), chunk size (4 / 8 / 16 KB), with vs. without the AI filter
- **Live test:** 30-day scan of newly published npm packages, confirmed via npm security takedowns and OpenSSF reports

The first stage 1 measurements, on 195 small packages, are in [`experiments/v1/`](experiments/v1/README.md): known malware and renamed clones are flagged with no benign false alarm, but malware from an unseen family mostly is not, which is the job of stage 2.

## ⚠️ Safety

This project handles **real, active malware**.

- Never run `npm install` on any sample.
- `data/` holds live malware in encrypted zips (password `infected`): extract them only inside WSL or a virtual machine, and never commit the extracted files.
- Keep other samples in their encrypted archives until needed; extract only inside a virtual machine.
- Malware is read strictly as text; PackGuard never executes package code.
- Suspicious live-scan findings are reported responsibly to npm's security team.
