# v7 benign npm corpus

A benign npm dataset built on the VPS with the `npm` CLI: `npm search` picks the
long-tail candidates, `npm pack` fetches the published tarballs, and the v6
filtering rules turn them into a benign reference set.

## What it replaces

`experiments/v6/` built its corpus with `urllib` against the registry API, which
is rate limited for the per-package download counts. This version asks npm
itself, so a plain `npm` install is the only prerequisite and the download
counts come from the registry's bulk endpoint.

## Pipeline

```bash
python3 experiments/v7/scripts/fetch_benign_npm.py \
    --popular 1500 --longtail 1500 --search-per-keyword 120
python3 experiments/v6/scripts/build_benign.py \
    --raw ~/packguard-data/v7/raw/npm \
    --refs ~/packguard-data/v7/benign_refs \
    --val ~/packguard-data/v7/val/source \
    --val-popular 0 --val-longtail 0
```

`fetch_benign_npm.py` is incremental: tarballs already in `index.json` are kept,
and monthly download counts are cached in `downloads.json`.

`build_benign.py` is reused unchanged from v6. The validation split is off
(`--val-popular 0 --val-longtail 0`), so every package lands in the reference
set instead of being set aside for tuning.

## Selections

| | |
|---|---|
| Popular | Random latest versions from `npm-high-impact` 1.13.0, shuffled with seed 20261105, at most 1,500 |
| Long-tail | Last 120 hits of each of 167 generic keywords in `npm search`, at most 2,000 downloads a month, not deprecated, at most 1,500 |
| Excluded | 12,819 DataDog `malicious_intent` package names, taken from the repository's Git tree listing |
| Size cap | Tarballs over 8 MiB unpacked are skipped |

## Results (2026-11-05)

| | |
|---|---|
| Raw corpus | 2,821 tarballs (1,348 popular, 1,473 long-tail), 245 MiB |
| Search candidates | 16,999 long-tail names, 1,668 under the download cap |
| Reference set | 2,549 packages (1,215 popular, 1,334 long-tail), 29,654 files, 70.4 MiB of JavaScript |
| Dropped | 201 packages without JavaScript, 4,795 repeated files, 71 packages left empty by the deduplication |

Locations on the VPS: `~/packguard-data/v7/raw/npm/` and
`~/packguard-data/v7/benign_refs/` with `benign_refs_manifest.json` next to it.
Nothing is committed: the extracted files are not in the repository, only the
two scripts above.

## Usage

```bash
packguard --mode known -B ~/packguard-data/v7/benign_refs <malware_refs> <package>
```
